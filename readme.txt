Candescent displays accessibility information in the Gutenberg block editor.

== Description ==

Candescent is an accessibility guidance plugin that displays alerts in certain Gutenberg blocks. See when the content you are adding doesn't meet accessibility guidelines quickly.

Get an alert in Paragraph blocks when:

* The font size is too small.
* The foreground and/or background colors lack contrast.

Get an alert in Image blocks when:

* The image's alt text is missing.
